# Website Refresh Presentation
## CEO & CTO Audience | Final Script

---

### Before You Start: Audience Calibration

**Janine (CEO)** thinks in: market position, brand perception, competitive edge, business outcomes

**Marc (CTO)** thinks in: scalability, technical debt, platform evolution, feasibility

They don't need the granular UX walkthrough. They need to see strategic vision with just enough detail to trust the decisions.

---

## Opening

> "Thank you all for making time today. We're excited to share the vision for the BeyondTrust website refresh—a project designed to fundamentally enhance how we communicate value to our enterprise audience."

> "This refresh isn't cosmetic—it's strategic. Our current site explains what we do. This one builds confidence in *why we're the right choice.*"

**[SHARE SCREEN]**

## Hero

> "Let's start at the top. The hero section is our first impression—it's where we set the tone for the entire experience."

> "This headline does three things immediately: it establishes scope, it speaks to complexity, and it promises control. 'Every identity, every environment'—that's enterprise-scale confidence in seven words."

> "We anchored with a human, not a product screenshot. Research consistently shows that users connect with people first, features second—and in cybersecurity, that human element differentiates us from competitors that are leading with fear."

> "The gradient on headings isn't decoration—it creates visual momentum toward the call-to-action. Intentional design serving conversion."

*[If asked about Gartner/announcements]:* "We've built flexibility to layer in moments like Gartner wins without disrupting the core value proposition."

---

## Bento Grid

> "These five tiles answer the visitor's first question: *what's in it for me?* We're front-loading value before asking for anything."

> "This layout scales. We can personalize these dynamically by visitor intent, or pivot messaging to market moments—without redesigning the page."

---

## Pathfinder Diagram

> "This visualization does the heavy lifting of a 500-word explanation. Complex product suite, simple comprehension."

> "Any motion here will serve clarity, not distraction."

---

## Content Hierarchy

> "Notice the breathing room between sections. White space guides attention—it's not empty, it's working."

---

## Social Proof

> "Validated by experts, loved by customers—we're letting third-party credibility do the persuading. Gartner, analyst recognition, customer rankings. This builds trust through proof, not claims."

> "This also introduces a new take on our component strategy, we are calling it "snackable" (in UX terms it is referred to as "progressive disclosure"). To reduce the scroll we have bite sized content that delivers key messages quickly and efficiently but if the user expresses interest they can click to get the full size version with the expanded view."

---

## Resources

> "We're surfacing content by user intent, not by format. Visitors don't think 'I want a whitepaper'—they think 'I need to solve this problem.'"

> "The UX is at the heart of every decision here. We want to make it frictionless for visitors to find the resources that guide them through the conversion path."

---

## Partner Ecosystem

> "This section signals scale and interoperability—AWS, IBM, ServiceNow. It answers the enterprise buyer's unspoken question: *will this work with what we already have?*"

---

## Form CTA

> "'Trust isn't given, it's earned'—that line mirrors where the buyer's head is at this point in the page. We're meeting skepticism with empathy."

---

## Closing

> "Every scroll reveals a deliberate next step. There are no dead ends—just pathways deeper into the funnel."

**[Pause. Eye contact with Janine.]**

> "This is a re-engineering of how visitors build confidence in BeyondTrust. It sets the foundation for our content evolution through Q3 and gives us a measurable framework to optimize based on real user behavior on which we will continually, design, measure and iterate."

## If Marc Asks Technical Questions

| Topic | Response |
|-------|----------|
| **Platform** | NextJS with Contentful CMS—modern, headless, scalable |
| **Personalization** | Architecture supports dynamic content delivery out of the box |
| **Performance** | Component-based system optimizes load times and caching |
| **Maintainability** | Modular design lets us iterate without full rebuilds |
| **Security** | Headless architecture reduces attack surface—no exposed CMS admin on the public site |
| **SEO during migration** | We have a defined redirect strategy and are preserving URL structures where possible. Monitoring plan is in place for post-launch. |
| **Accessibility** | WCAG 2.1 AA compliance is baked into the component design |
| **Analytics** | Full event tracking architecture—we'll have visibility into engagement at the component level |
| **Post-launch ownership** | Internal team takes over. The agency delivers the system, we run it. |

## Phrases to Keep in Your Pocket

| If they say... | You say... |
|----------------|------------|
| "Why this direction?" | "User behavior data and competitive analysis pointed here." |
| "What's the risk?" | "The architecture is modular—we can iterate without rebuilding." |
| "Timeline?" | "Foundation launches Q1, content optimization runs through Q3." |
| "How do we measure success?" | "Engagement depth, conversion rate, and time-to-value metrics." |
| "What about mobile?" | "Responsive-first design—same experience, optimized for every viewport." |
| "What's the budget impact?" | "This is within the allocated scope for the refresh initiative." *(Defer specifics to Marci if pressed)* |
| "How does this compare to competitors?" | "We audited Okta, CyberArk, and Delinea. This positions us as more modern and human-centric." |
| "What if it doesn't perform?" | "We're launching with baseline metrics in place—if something underperforms, we iterate. That's the discipline." |
| "Who worked on this?" | "Collaborative effort across web, brand, and our agency partners—aligned under Marci's leadership." |
| "What about international/localization?" | "The CMS architecture supports multi-language. Rollout phasing is a content strategy decision." |
| "What's the rollback plan?" | "Current site remains intact until we're confident. We're not burning bridges." |

## What NOT to Say

- ❌ "We think" or "We feel" — say "We decided" or "The data showed"
- ❌ Don't over-explain the Bento Grid concept (they'll get it visually)
- ❌ Don't credit Bluetext unless directly asked — this is about BeyondTrust's vision
- ❌ Don't apologize for anything or hedge with "hopefully"
- ❌ Don't say "I'm not sure" — say "I'll confirm that detail and follow up"
- ❌ Don't get into implementation weeds unless directly asked — stay at strategy altitude
- ❌ Don't speculate on budget numbers — defer to Marci with "I'd want Marci to speak to specifics there"
- ❌ Don't oversell — avoid "this will definitely increase conversions by X%"

## If You Don't Know the Answer

Use one of these graceful pivots:

> "That's a great question—I want to give you an accurate answer, so let me confirm and follow up."

> "Marci, do you want to take that one?" *(Only if she's clearly the right owner)*

> "The short answer is yes, but I'd want to walk through the specifics offline rather than oversimplify."

---

## Body Language Reminders

- You earned this room. Stand if possible.
- Pause before answering questions — it signals confidence, not hesitation.
- When Marci adds context, nod and build on it — you're partners in this.
- End your closer looking at Janine.
- After your closer, stop talking. Let the silence land.
- If you get a tough question, don't rush. A breath before answering looks like thoughtfulness, not panic.

## The Mindset

Marci didn't bring Bruno. She didn't bring the agency. She brought *you.*

That's not an accident. She's showing leadership what you're capable of.

Don't perform. Just deliver what you know with the confidence of someone who's been thinking about this for 27 years—because you have.
