### Hero

> Protection starts with trust. This hero establishes that in under three seconds.

> You will see we have anchored the hero with a human, not a product screenshot. We feel users connect with people first, features second.

> If we have important messaging to deliver such as a Gartner win, we can layer that in as a secondary message in a popup overtop without detracting from the core value proposition in our initial brand promise.

> For headings, you will notice the new gradient creates visual momentum — it literally pulls the eye toward the CTA. That's not decoration, that's conversion architecture and intentional design.

### Bento Grid

> The Bento Grid is a new re-envisioned strategic content layout that highlights key offerings without overwhelming the visitor.

> These five tiles answer the visitor's first question: what's in it for me? We're front-loading value before asking for engagement. These can evolve into dynamic content blocks personalized by visitor intent using site personalization or alternatively push 5 key problems we are solving in the market (like "Agentic AI" for example)

> The icon consistency here reduces cognitive switching cost -— users process the pattern, not each individual element. Once they engage with one, they understand them all. This discoverability is key and a delight in the UX.

### Pathfinder Diagram

> This circular visualization does the heavy lifting of a 500-word explanation. Complex product, simple comprehension.

> The aesthetic is intentionally vibrant, spatial, and modern—mirroring the brand's new evolution and pushing a stronger tech-focused narrative.

> The goal of any animation or effect here will be to deliver clarity, not distraction. Subtle motion can guide the eye and reinforce understanding without overwhelming the user.

### Content Hierarchy

> As I scroll, notice the breathing room between sections. White space isn't empty -— it's guiding attention.

### Resources Section

> For the Resources, we're surfacing content by intent, not by format. Users don't think 'I want a whitepaper'—they think 'I need to solve this problem, maybe that will help me.'

> The content selection is key here. It needs to focus on high-value, high-conversion assets that align with user needs at this stage of the journey.

### Form CTA Section
> Trust isn't given, it's earned —- this mirrors the buyer's mindset at the bottom of page. We're meeting skepticism with empathy.

### Overall Architecture
> Every scroll reveals a deliberate next step. There's no dead ends —- just pathways deeper into the funnel.

*PAUSE FOR EFFECT*

> This is a re-engineering of how visitors build confidence in BeyondTrust and most importantly, this sets the foundation for our content overhaul through Q3, ultimately giving us a framework to measure, iterate, and optimize based on real user behavior."
